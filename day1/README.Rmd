* R [@R] is an implementation of the S programming language, which was created in 1976 by **[John Chambers](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chambers_(statistician))** while at Bell Labs. 

* R itself was created by **[Ross Ihaka](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka)** and **[Robert Gentleman](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician))** at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. First release in 1995.

* Currently developed by the **[R Development Core Team](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)**, of which Chambers is a member. 

<!-- R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. -->

# R packages

CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) is

> [A] network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R -- https://cran.r-project.org/

Bioconductor

> [A]n open source, open development software project to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is based primarily on the R programming language. -- https://www.bioconductor.org/about/



# Reproducible Research

[![](../fig/Rlogo.svg){.class width="200px"}](https://r-project.org)

> The goal of reproducible research is to tie specific instructions to data analysis and experimental data so that scholarship can be recreated, better understood and verified. Packages in R for this purpose can be split into groups for: literate programming, package reproducibility, code/data formatting tools, format convertors, and object caching. --- [CRAN Task View: Reproducible Research](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html){.class target="_blank"}
