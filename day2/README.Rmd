We will work on simulations!

Today's goals are:

1.  Learn more about base R, in particular
1.  Use extarnal data: `read.table`,
2.  Data structures: `vector`, `matrix`, `list`
3.  Functional programming: Creating functions in R,
2.  Control flow: `for` loops (we'll leave ),
3.  Pseudo random numbers: `sample`, `runif`, `rnorm`
4.  Summarizing: `boxplot`

5.  Extra 1: Applying parallel computing
6.  Extra 6: Animating our simulation with `magick`.


We'll do all of this by runing some monte carlo simulations models...

*   The hyperbolic discount problem: In simple words, people overvalue the present (which yields regret in the future!)

*   Online tools for projecting retirement savings are usually very optimistic (sorry!), like yielding a 5\% fix average return (no bond gives you that!)

*   We will perform some simulation models using real data and, instead of obtaining a point estimate of our future savings, we will obtain confidence intervals (a range of possible outcomes).


# Today's tasks

1.  Read in the data from returns from the stocks market.

2.  Create a function that simulates a random return trejectory by sampling from the stocks market.

3.  Create a function that generates a random unemployment trajectory (poisson process).

4.  Mix all in a for-loop function that creates a random pension savings trajectory.

5.  Wrap it around 1,000 simulation, and plot the output using the `boxplot` function in R.


# About the dataset

# About the model

$$
S_t = S_{t-1}\times(1 + r_t) + I_t\times c_t
$$

Where $S_t$ is your savings balance in time $t$, $r_t\sim R$ is the return rate in time $t$, $I_t$ is your income in time $t$, and $c_t$ is your contribution rate in time $t$.
