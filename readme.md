# R Bootcamp for Scientific Computing <img src="flyer/fig/trojan-rlogo.svg" width="150px" align="right">

</div>

This boot camp has as main goal to give a general overview of scientific
computing, and in particular, on the R programming language. It is
divided in 5 days. The first three days will be a mix of presentations
and hands-on work, and the last two will be 100% hands-on where the
attendees are expected to work on a short project and present their
results at the end of the boot camp.

## Dates

The bootcamp will take place on the week of Monday August 13th, 2018:

* Lecture 1: Monday 13, 10AM to 2PM -- room 116
* Lecture 2: Tuesday 14, 10AM to 2PM -- room 116
* Lecture 3: Wednesday 15, 10AM to 2PM -- room 116
* Hackathon: Thursday 16, 2:30PM to 5:30PM -- room 166
* Final Presentations: Friday 17, 10AM to 1PM -- room 114


## Schedule

1.  Day 1:

    a.  Reproducible research: An overview

    b.  Intro to R

        i.  What is R: A slide of history
        ii. Why R?
        iii. RStudio

    c.  Version control: Intro to git w/ github

    d.  **Assignment**: Create a new github repository to save your
        > project. To do such, you'll need to create a Github account.
        > The repo should include the following: (1) A readme.md file
        > and A .gitgnore file.

2.  Day 2:

    a.  Data structures

        i.  Scalars, vectors and matrices
        ii. Lists
        iii. Attributes

    b.  I/O data

        i.  Raw data (plain text files)
        ii. Binary format (just mention it!)
        iii. R data: rda, rds

    c.  Pseudo Random Number Generation

        i.  Algorithms
        ii. List functions

    d.  Control flow structures (for, while, etc.)

        i.  Bootstrap
        ii. Hastings ratio
        iii. MLE using Newton-Raphson

    e.  **Assignments**: (1) Read in some dataset using the read.table
        > function, (2) Generate a subsample of 10% the data using the
        > runif function and compute the mean of it. (3) Repeat yourself
        > and draw a 1,000 samples of size 10% and, using the functions
        > hist and abline, plot a histogram of the mean and draw a
        > vertical line at the place where the total mean lives.

3.  Day 3

    a.  Functional programming

        i.  Repeat yourself: Why is it a good idea
        ii. Function structures and scoping

    b.  Plotting

        i.  Base: The par
        ii. ggplot2: An overview

    c.  Presentation of projects (proposed):

        i.  Monopoly (US version)
        ii. Linear regression
        iii. Conway's Game of Life
        iv. Mandelbrot and friends
        v.  Simulate PI
        vi. Langton's Ant

4.  Day 4: Hackathon.
5.  Day 5: Present the results.
